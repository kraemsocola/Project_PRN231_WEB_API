					<description><![CDATA[Big product like its cost and good looking too. I got this basket to keep our puppy&#039;s toys in. I wanted something I didn&#039;t have to worry about if the puppy started chewing on the basket itself. Well, have no worries. The basket is one of the puppy&#039;s favorite toys. After she empties it out and plays with some of the toys, she comes back to the basket.Thank you!]]></description>
