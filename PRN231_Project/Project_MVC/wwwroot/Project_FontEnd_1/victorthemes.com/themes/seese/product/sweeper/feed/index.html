					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s the best quality. It&#039;s a little flimsy, but it works pretty well. I used it twice already and it picked up a lot of crumbs and dry cat food off the kitchen floor. Not a bad sweeper for the price. Simple and useful Sweeper, I love the skill and time put in, all the best!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i love how this broom has smaller grey bristles on one side and bigger black bristles on the other.. the grey bristles really are great for smaller crumbs and even dust! my old broom had broke about a week before this came in.. i always thought that a broom is a broom.. well i couldn&#039;t be more wrong!! this broom is great. This is awesome! Good luck with sales!]]></description>
